# Hexdump

A basic file printing tool for Neotron systems. This program takes an argument
which is assumed to be a filename. That file is opened, and printed out as hex.
The output is similar to the UNIX command `hexdump -C`.

See the general sample application [README](../README.md) for compilation instructions.
